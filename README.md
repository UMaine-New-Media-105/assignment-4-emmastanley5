For question 1 i made "fireworks" with multiple arcs placed on top of each other to make a "firework looking" shape. 
for question 2 I used my code from question 1 to help make up a graph, Although I wanted them to look more like fireworks I ended up getting a cool flower looking shape that is filled with diffrent colors which gives it a cool affect.
for question 3 I used some of the code again from the forst assigment to make a random graph of my fireworks and I think this turn about a lot more looking like fireworks than flowers like the last assigment
for question 4 I used ellipses to make on going colorfull rows that go into a grainent
